# Triangle
using p5.js


I created animated scene where a white triangle is continuously drawn on top of a background that changes in opacity. 
The background is initially a transparent red, which becomes opaquer as the program runs, creating a fading effect. 
This results in a dynamic background where the red colour gradually intensifies while the white triangle remains static, 
always appearing clearly on top of the shifting colour.
